1. preprocess_line function, input: text string or file, output: input minus all special characters (return statement)

2.1. function to read in training file (put file into a variable)

2.2. function that counts all the character trigrams (input is the variable we stored the file in)

2.3. function that estimates the probabilities of 2.2 (input will be the counts of 2.2.)

2.4 a function that writes the output of 2.3 into a new file

3. a function to generate random output from the output of 2.3 

4. function that takes as input the test document and the output from 2.3 outputs the perplexity of the test document under the output of 2.3. We're taking each separate output of 2.3 (English, Spanish and German, so we have to feed the models in separately, we're only inputting one model at a time.)


Hint 1: For 2., we will use MLE as our estimation method.

Hint 2: we need to find out what data type will work best.
